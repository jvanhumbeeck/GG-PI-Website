	  <p class="subtitle respp">Our main plan is to built a drone. We have some other things that we want to accomplish too. After building the drone we will upgrade the fligtpilot with a PI motherboard. This will enable us to work more freely and give us the possibilities to program and run the flightpilot on a more advanced software. This will take a huge amount of time and money. So we want to take it stap by stap, start slow then move as we get more experienced we begin upgrading the drone. We know it is possible. We just have to start small and built the foundation. </br></br> <button id="btnmap" class="btn" href="#">Click for more&#187;</button></p>

	  <p class="subtitle respp">This project started out just for a school course. But it will most likely grow into something huge. We are both in physics courses. That includes the possibility to start a project like this one. The momment we had to decide what project we would chose. Knowing that both of us love everything that has to do with flying. The idea of building a drone flourished in both of our minds. That being said there was not much to speculate about. So we got to work.</p>
