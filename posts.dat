    <text>After looking many videos we fell in love with "the racing drone" design. We thought. If we want to built a sepcial drone than why building a normal one. Taht doesn't make sense. So we quickly found a brand new design for the drone that we could easily purchase on Hobbyking.</text>

    <title>Going FPV</title>

    <text>Making the dicision to go FPV *first person view was not an easy one. It would mean that we would have a lot more work to do. And that is would hard. Not only budget wise but also tech and regulation wise.&lt;h3&gt;Tech&lt;/h3&gt;To be able to see wat your drone sees, you need a good solid connection with your drone. This is not possible with a normal phone via wifi, so we had to find an other way. It was this moment that meant we had to invest a lot more into this drone than that we first thought. After searching a wile on hobbyking we stubled on a subsection of FPV drones. This was were we found the selution. The fatschark V3.&lt;h3&gt;Budget&lt;/h3&gt;There are many different ways to upgrade a drone to FPV. First we had no clue how this worked and how we could modify our drone. So we started to do some research. After a week of looking at videos on youtube we found a proffesional FPV youtuber. He has all kinds of videos about drones and FPV. He also gives good objectif reviews of all the products he uses. So we got to work, looking up all kinds of FPV accecoires on Hobbyking that he recomended. Doing this research gave us such a better view on how drones really work. How to built one and so on.</text>

    <title>The batteries</title>

    <text>In order to power our drone. We'll need batteries. Luckily we still have 2 Lipo batteries laying around in the workshop. Using these will safe us some money. We also know out of experience that they are trustworthy. Because the last thing we want is a drone that ends up in flames.&lt;br&gt;We will use 2 separate powersupplies. One that provides electicity for our thurst. And one to power our Raspberry PI 3. This means that we can easely change the batteries for our props without turning of the system.&lt;br&gt;The batteries that we'll use for our thrust are the turnigy 3s 20c 2200mah. We have two of these. The battery it self is very high kwality and is used in most main-stream AC planes.</text>

    <text>To get a better idea of how the drone will look like we used a website named &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com&lt;/a&gt; on this website you can see multiple prefabs. Under every 3Dprefab there is a downloadlink. These files are compatible with most 3D printers. This means that we can easely print it. Thanks to these websites we can work more efficient.&lt;br&gt;This is one of those 3Dprefabs that we will most likely be using for our drone.&lt;br&gt;LINK: &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2269499"&gt;Shuriken&lt;/a&gt;</text>

    <text>Getting the the drone to fly on a PI controlled software won't be easy. It is something new for both of us. Luckily we have people that can help us. Sure there is a long way to a fully operating PI-controlled drone. We might even download software from the internet to install on our drone. Just to get to know the PI's "behavior". Software is free to download on &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org"&gt;raspberrypi.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is a Raspberry PI? The PI is a very small computer. Just like every other computer it contains a CPU, RAM, a power supply and storage possibilities.</text>

    <title>Mindmap</title>

    <text>This mindmap shows all the futur objectives. Some are possible and some aren't. Having fantasy is important. But to be able to really built something is so much better. That is why we made this mindmap. It is an easy road to follow and it gives us a good foundation to start on. A clear path is something that is of major import when you're creating a project off this size.&lt;br&gt;You can click on the picture down below. But if you want to explore our mindmap even better then just looking at a picture just go to: &lt;a href="https://mm.tt/975947672?t=UG2Q2uHqL2"&gt;GG-PI Mindmap&lt;/a&gt; "No login required".&lt;br&gt;Or if you want to create your own mindmap. Go to: &lt;a href="https://www.mindmeister.com"&gt;Mindmeister.com&lt;/a&gt;.</text>

    <text>There are a couple of things that we want to built. Thse are sort of upgrades of the drone. Building these things wont be easy. We will need the drone design to be able to upgrade it.</text>

    <text>This is our electric circuit. We used a program named Fritzing to really show the tech side of our drone. In this sketch everything that is on the tech side is included. Thist makes it easyier to work with as a blueprint for the electrical design of the drone.</text>
